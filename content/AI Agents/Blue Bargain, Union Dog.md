## ⚠️ Important Note on Memory & Privacy

This agent was originally developed using **private memory structures**, including `.json` vector files derived from personal medical, financial, and academic notes.

These memory files **are not** included in any public or paid version.

> What you’ll receive is the **scaffold, prompts, and personality**—not the personal data that powered their evolution.
