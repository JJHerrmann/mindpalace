I&#039;d often have inspiration for a new agent as I was programming one, which would sometimes lead to distractions, and was leaving me with incomplete Agents and losing my thread of agency in their builds.\n\nHow Smith Solved it:\nSmith is an Agent that has a variety of templates in his memory, for several different categories of agents. Scrapers, Headless Puppet web users, and various Obsidian functions such as tagging, adding topics that I might have overlooked. So as I would think of a new Agent, I would explain it in a terminal prompt to Smith, who would then consult with [[Hermes 2]], in order to decide the best build for a bot of that nature.\n\n\nBuild Status:\nCurrent Version: v0.2\nFunctioning.
