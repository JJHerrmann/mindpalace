## Personal Codename: Agent Au (Gold)

#### *"The Best Thing About Being Me... There Are So MANY Me's!"**
## Pain Point:
	Agent Smith was designed as a personality Agent that would assist in the creation of Agents for as fast as I can ideate. I'd often have inspiration for a new agent as I was programming one, which would sometimes lead to distractions, and was leaving me with incomplete Agents and losing my thread of agency in their builds.
## How Smith Solved it:
	Smith is an Agent that has a variety of templates in his memory, for several different categories of agents. Scrapers, Headless Puppet web users, and various Obsidian functions such as tagging, adding topics that I might have overlooked. So as I would think of a new Agent, I would explain it in a terminal prompt to Smith, who would then consult with [[Hermes 2]], in order to decide the best build for a bot of that nature.
