Benji, in the context of a program like Workday, would be a "Benefits Partner" level agent, keeping him from overriding processes such as being an Administrator of an HR Partner. These are essential tasks that should be handled by human eyes and hands only, for the sake of security and oversight over the automated process.

An employee would submit new benefits paperwork under one of the three enrollment flags, either **New Hire Enrollment**, **Life Event**, ** or **Yearly Open Enrollment.**.****

Using Headless puppet controls, Benji would then load an employee through the distribution list, selecting one of the three categories for the processing, selecting if the employee qualified for a benefits change based on the flag they selected when filing for their paperwork.

This would not be without Tags, having Benji check against the calendar for an et al method of yearly enrollment, or checking the employee file for a hire date for a per populi approach to yearly enrollment, as well as flagging the case for paperwork certification by human eyes in the event of a life changing event (Such as checking a state issued marriage certificate, or a birth certificate for a new child). 

Benji is not a replacement for your HR overall, Benji is the guy that supercharges your HR process like a can of nitrous shotgunned into a tank of jetfuel.
